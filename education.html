                                                Devi Balika Vidyalaya is a public national girls' school in Colombo, Sri
                                                Lanka. Girls are admitted at grade six, based on the results of an
                                                island-wide scholarship examination. Like other national schools it is
                                                controlled by the central government, as opposed to a provincial
                                                council.

                                                Polytechnic Institution, it was the first polytechnic to open in
