                    Devi Balika Vidyalaya is a public national girls' school in Colombo,
                    Sri Lanka. Girls are admitted at grade six, based on the results of
                    an island-wide scholarship examination. Like other national schools
                    it is controlled by the central government, as opposed to a
                    provincial council.
